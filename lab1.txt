CS452/EE465 Computer Graphics Spring 2015
Lab #1

due: Friday, 1/30/15 at midnight

Write a WebGL application that will display three different 2D shapes, one at a time. A left mouse click
will toggle among the shapes.

The initial canvas will display the first shape. A left mouse click will cause the second shape to be 
displayed, another left mouse click will result in the third shape to be displayed, and finally another
left click will display the first shape. So every time there is a left mouse click, the next shape will
be displayed.

Assumptions:
1. vertex coordinates will be in the range [-1.0, +1.0]
2. use webgl-utils.js, initShaders.js and MV.js from Angel
3. three files are required in the solution: lab1.html, lab1.js and lab1.README. The lab1.README file
will contain your name and date along with a brief description of your solution
